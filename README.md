# The well-known tic-tac-toe game
This project was created to improve my skills as a programmer, in particular trying to write clean code.\
I tried to use 4 [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.\
[Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/) is used as a library for window creation and drawing, but the structure of the code is such that anyone can switch from Arcade to something else at any time without unnecessary pain.

## Run
```
git clone https://github.com/TheYahton/tic-tac-toe
cd tic-tac-toe
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
